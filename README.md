# youtube-clone
This repository contains a static, front-end clone of the YouTube homepage, created using modern HTML and CSS. The project demonstrates a responsive layout, semantic HTML structure, and CSS styling to replicate the user interface of YouTube. It's an excellent example for learning and practicing front-end web development skills.
